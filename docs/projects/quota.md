# Quota tool

This tool is the very basic of tools in the toolbox which gives you your current quota. This gives you the total used and remaining quota in all your legacy folders or user root folders. It requires no additional arguments just that your earthengine api is enabled.

Quota can now also handle Google Earth Engine with Google Cloud Projects enabled so you can pass project path as an argument
